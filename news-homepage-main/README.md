## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility in mind

### What I learned

The use of max-width and margin-inline auto with 6 columns layout seems the best way to create a masonry type layout.

### Continued development

Start to use the new CSS features, it could replace SCSS in most use case.
